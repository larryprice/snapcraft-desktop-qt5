# snapcraft-desktop-qt5

A pared down version of https://github.com/ubuntu/snapcraft-desktop-helpers for only qt5. The original snapcraft-desktop-helpers desktop-qt5 does not currently work on zesty and, as far as I can tell, is probably abandoned. This is a minimal repository for building qt5-based snap applications and a semi-fork of the original repository.

See [demos/qt5/snapcraft.yaml](demos/qt5/snapcraft.yaml) for usage details.
